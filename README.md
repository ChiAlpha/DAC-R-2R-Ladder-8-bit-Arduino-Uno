# DAC-R-2R-Ladder-8-bit-Arduino-Uno (Forked from https://github.com/mfaliha/DAC-R-2R-Ladder-8-bit-Arduino-Uno.git)

Creating ramp or sin wave by using DAC R-2R Ladder 8-bit Arduino Uno

Using Port D (Pin 0-7) in Arduino Uno

This version was created specifically to work with PlatformIO on Atom editor.

It also contains the program (listener) used to plot the readings on your PC using Serial connection with Arduino. (https://github.com/devinaconley/arduino-plotter.git) If you use an OS apart from Linux, download your own version of listener from https://github.com/devinaconley/arduino-plotter/wiki/Installation-and-Quickstart .

Connect the circuit, plug in the Arduino Uno, and then click on listener and run it.
